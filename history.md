In this file, I will be planning and writing down what I currently know 
of the history.


Timeline of FOSS class
    • 2008 MIT proposed one laptop per child (OLPC) – big humanitarian tech project
    • SJ wanted students to make games for OLPC


## FOSSBOX: 
    • ~2012


## FOSS@RIT:
    • Started out as a community of people with interest in free and open source software at RIT
    • Also had a purpose of keeping FOSSbox alive.
    • Existed in parallel with FOSS@MAGIC


## FOSS@MAGIC: 
    • "maybe 2018-2019"
    • Started out as just the Open Source minor
    • Existed in parallel with FOSS@RIT


## LibreCorps:
LibreCorps is an experiential learning program where students are deployed to work on real world open source software and data projects, supporting faculty partners with direct software development as well as community management, documentation, design, and other forms of non-code contribution.
RIT LibreCorps has been partnered intermittently with the UNICEF Office of Innovation since 2014.
In 2020, the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/) provided [support](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/10076) for an effort led by the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Stephen Jacobs to design and launch an undergraduate-anchored program: [LibreCorps](https://fossrit.github.io/librecorps/). 
As a successful pilot, LibreCorps reached up to 24 supported faculty-driven software projects!


## OPEN@RIT:
    • Sometime after Mid-year 2021
